# Purrfect Match Landing Page

The landing page for a Start-up, using Bootstrap 3

This project is part of a Web Development course I took. This part focuses specifically on Bootstrap 3.

It's a simple landing page for a fake start-up company, which includes a custom Navbar, Glyphicons and Bootstrap's default buttons.
